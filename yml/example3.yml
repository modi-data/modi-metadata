# The summary should contain a thorough description of the study design and execution.
# The description must be complete and self-contained, but can contain links
# to images and further information (but keep in mind that the description
# must make sense even if those links should stop working.)
# Multiline strings can be written by starting the value with a pipe symbol (|).

    objectively i would object to the notion of the need for the existance of an objective. Why not act
    randomly and see where the ship strands?

  # Which are the data are from. Can be an exact coordinate, a polygon, a town name, a country name, etc.
  # If providing coordinates/polygons, it must be encoded as WKT with an SRID of 4326.

  # Which type of data this is. 
  # Must be one or more of: 
  #     survey, interviews, mobile network, itsg5, lane markings, signage, physical road infrastructure, 
  #     speed/acceleration, video, pictures, gnss, lidar, radar, weather, vehicle probe data, events, other.
  # You may add multiple data types if relevant, separated by a comma.

  # Which of the use cases in MODI this dataset is related to.
  # Must be one of: UCNL, UCGE, UCSE, UCNO, UCCCAM, Other tasks

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata
# "Administrative metadata are collected for the effective operation and management of data
# storage and catalogues. This administrative information, covering various topics, is stored
# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."
administrative:
  # Who has rights to use this dataset?
  rights: Limited rights, see Access for contact info
  
  # Does the dataset have a specific license for usage?
  license: MIT
  
  # Who can access the dataset?
  access: limited, contact random.acts@gmail.com

  # Any constraints in usage of the dataset?
  constraints: |
    Can not be presented anywhere in raw form, only after enough aggregation to anonymize
    each driver sufficiently.
  
  # Can the dataset be used for free, or does usage incur any costs/billing for the user?
  billing: The dataset can be used without cost as long as access and constraints are agreed upon.

  # When the data set will stop existing (for example due to privacy regulations).
  # Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  data_end_of_life: 2023-10-01

  # A more detailed description of the various processes of the data collection,
  # for example the methods/tools used to collect the data, filtering, post-processing,
  # storage file structure, etc.
  # This should include information about relevant conditions during the data collection
  # (for example weather, climate, time of day, etc).
  # Each key under "processes" can be custom made, and there can be as many as is
  # necessary. The proposed keys are just examples.
  processes:
    collection_preparation: |
      Volunteers were recruited through targeted social media ads and e-mails to relevant
      people or groups. Each volunteer got an OBU mounted in their vehicle.
    collection: |
      The OBUs mounted in the volunteer's vehicles collected data from the first day they
      were operational. For the first two weeks, the OBUs collected data silently, without
      giving the driver any information at all. These data are used as a baseline for driver
      behaviour.
      For the next 6 weeks, the OBUs HMI interface was active, and drivers were informed about
      road pricing zones and costs.
