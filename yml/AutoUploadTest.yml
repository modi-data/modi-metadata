# The summary should contain a thorough description of the study design and execution.
# The description must be complete and self-contained, but can contain links

# must make sense even if those links should stop working.)
# Multiline strings can be written by starting the value with a pipe symbol (|).
summary:

  why_was_it_collected: |
    Volunteers were recruited in the Trondheim area. Their vehicles got an OBU that
    recorded their GNSS position and speed every second, as well as displaying a map with
    the various geo-fence zones and their pricing.

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    Learn how road user charging together with geo-fencing was accepted by participants
    and investigate the readiness of the technology

  objectives: |
    Would there be a change in behaviour as a result of the system? Is GNSS based road
    user charging practically possible for personal vehicles from an OBU perspective? Is
    there acceptance for such a solution?

  research_questions: |
    The experiment was conducted for approximately two months, with different start ups
    and endings for all participants over a monthly period. In addition one pre-survey
    and one post-survey was conducted to capture acceptence data (not in this data set).
    The first two weeks, data was collected without showing the user any road charging or
    geo-fence information. These data were used as a baseline for driver behaviour.

  experimental_plan: |
    Drivers license required, living in or near the Trondheim area, and volunteering for
    the experiment.

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."

  summary: |
    The OBUs mounted in the volunteer's vehicles collected data from the first day they
    were operational. For the first two weeks, the OBUs collected data silently, without
    giving the driver any information at all. These data are used as a baseline for
    driver behaviour.
    For the next 6 weeks, the OBUs HMI interface was active, and
    drivers were informed about road pricing zones and costs.
