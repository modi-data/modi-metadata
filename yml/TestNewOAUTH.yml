# The summary should contain a thorough description of the study design and execution.
# The description must be complete and self-contained, but can contain links

# must make sense even if those links should stop working.)

summary:

  why_was_it_collected: |
    Volunteers were recruited in the Trondheim area. Their vehicles got an OBU that
    recorded their GNSS position and speed every second, as well as displaying a map with
    the various geo-fence zones and their pricing.

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    Learn how road user charging together with geo-fencing was accepted by participants
    and investigate the readiness of the technology

  objectives: |
    Would there be a change in behaviour as a result of the system? Is GNSS based road
    user charging practically possible for personal vehicles from an OBU perspective? Is
    there acceptance for such a solution?

  research_questions: |
    The experiment was conducted for approximately two months, with different start ups
    and endings for all participants over a monthly period. In addition one pre-survey
    and one post-survey was conducted to capture acceptence data (not in this data set).
    The first two weeks, data was collected without showing the user any road charging or
    geo-fence information. These data were used as a baseline for driver behaviour.

  experimental_plan: |
    Drivers license required, living in or near the Trondheim area, and volunteering for
    the experiment.

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata
# "Administrative metadata are collected for the effective operation and management of data
# storage and catalogues. This administrative information, covering various topics, is stored
# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."
administrative:

  # The version number of this dataset, used to keep track of different
  # versions if it is uploaded multiple times.
  # The version number can be numeric, date-based, or anything else, but
  # it must be easy to see which version is newer without further knowledge.
  version_number: 2023-06-02

  # The date this dataset was uploaded. Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  archiving_date: 

  # A unique identifier for this dataset. This will be used to identify this and
  # future updates in the metadata database, and must never be changed after the
  # dataset has been uploaded for the first time.
  unique_dataset_id: Limited rights, see Access for contact info

  # Who has rights to use this dataset?
  rights: MIT

  # Does the dataset have a specific license for usage?
  license: limited, contact petter.arnesen@sintef.no

  # Who can access the dataset?
  access: |
    Can not be presented anywhere in raw form, only after enough aggregation to anonymize
    each driver sufficiently.

  # Any constraints in usage of the dataset?
  constraints: |
    The dataset can be used without cost as long as access and constraints are agreed
    upon.

  # Can the dataset be used for free, or does usage incur any costs/billing for the user?
  billing: 2023-10-01

  # When the data set will stop existing (for example due to privacy regulations).
  # Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  data_end_of_life: 

  # A more detailed description of the various processes of the data collection,
  # for example the methods/tools used to collect the data, filtering, post-processing,
  # storage file structure, etc.
  # This should include information about relevant conditions during the data collection
  # (for example weather, climate, time of day, etc).
  # Each key under "processes" can be custom made, and there can be as many as is
  # necessary. The proposed keys are just examples.

      Volunteers were recruited through targeted social media ads and e-mails to relevant people or groups. Each volunteer got an OBU mounted in their vehicle.
