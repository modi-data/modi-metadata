summary:
  why_was_it_collected: |
    The aim with this study is to map and consider perspectives on automation among core stakeholders in the European logistics chain

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    A link to the survey was shared via email to relevant stakeholders in the MODI project. ALICE, CLEPA, Port of Moss, Maersk and ITS Norway also shared the survey to their members and networks, both via email and LinkedIn.

  objectives: |
    The objective is to map the automation readiness within the different parts of the logistics chain

  research_questions: |
    Some key questions included in the survey are whether the actors in logistics are prepared to welcome automation, if they see it as providing mainly opportunities or obstacles, what kind of new risks it entails and which parts of the logistics chain that have the most potential to benefit from automation.

  experimental_plan: |
    Initially the survey was distributed via email to MODI contacts, and thereafter shared by CLEPA, ALICE, ITS Norway, port of Moss and Maersk to their respective members and/or networks. Methods for distribution was through targeted emails, newsletters, dedicated LinkedIn-posts and by directed emails to the relevant networks/members of CLEPA, ALICE and ITS Norway.

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata
# "Administrative metadata are collected for the effective operation and management of data
# storage and catalogues. This administrative information, covering various topics, is stored
# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."
administrative:
  # The version number of this dataset, used to keep track of different
  # versions if it is uploaded multiple times.
  # The version number can be numeric, date-based, or anything else, but
  # it must be easy to see which version is newer without further knowledge.
  version_number: 1

  # The date this dataset was uploaded. Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  archiving_date: 2025-01-27

  # A unique identifier for this dataset. This will be used to identify this and
  # future updates in the metadata database, and must never be changed after the
  # dataset has been uploaded for the first time.

  billing: The dataset can be used without cost as long as access and constraints are agreed upon.

  # When the data set will stop existing (for example due to privacy regulations).
  # Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

  # A more detailed description of the various processes of the data collection,
  # for example the methods/tools used to collect the data, filtering, post-processing,
  # storage file structure, etc.
  # This should include information about relevant conditions during the data collection
  # (for example weather, climate, time of day, etc).
  # Each key under "processes" can be custom made, and there can be as many as is
  # necessary. The proposed keys are just examples.
  processes:
    collection: |
      We used a survey tool called Netigate to develop the survey. Then, we generated a survey link that was shared to relevant stakeholders via email and LinkedIn.
    filtering: |
      This data set is the raw data
    aggregation: |
      This data set is the raw data, but aggregated data can be shared if neccessary and is already available in a project memo at the MODI Sharepoint.

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."

  summary: |
    Microsoft Excel Workbook with 7 pages. The first is a title page, the second a minireport of the survey,
    and the rest of the pages (Side 2 - Side 6) contains the questions and answers of the survey.

  # File format. Please include attributes such as delimiter for CSV, decimal separator,
  # thousand separator (if any), and any other properties that is relevant for parsing the data.
  file_format: Microsoft Excel Workbook (.xlsx)

  # Please describe the storage structure of the data. If it consists of flat files, the folder
  # structure and file naming can be relevant. If it is a database, a description of the relevant
  # tables, indices, triggers and views is important.
  file_structure: |
    A single .xlsx file.

  # Which tools can be used to read the data. Especially important for non-standard formats.
  required_tools: Excel

  # If the files were made using a specific tool, the tool name and version may be relevant
  # for reading the data.
  tool_versions: N/A

  # Additional keys and values can be added here if this is a non-standard format that requires
  # a more detailed explanation.

# 5.3.1 Descriptive metadata
# "Descriptive metadata shall include detailed information needed to understand each part of a
# dataset. The purpose is to describe the dataset and build trust in it—by providing not only the
# characteristics of each measure or component, but also information about how the data were
# generated and collected."
descriptive:
  # The descriptions can vary by data type.
  # For each data field in your dataset, please fill out all relevant parameters from section
  # 5.3.1 of the DSF, and enter the attributes using the "Data description item" in lower-case
  # as the key. The following list lists the most relevant attributes from the tables, see
  # tables 3 to 9 in the DSF for full explanations.

  # - description
  # - data_precision
  # - unit
  # - sample_rate
  # - filter
  # - origin
  # - bias
  # - type
  # - definition

  # Please note the following additions to the DSF:
  # - When dealing with coordinates, the SRID must be specified with the srid key.
  # - When dealing with times, the time zone must be specified with the timezone key.
  # - When dealing with dates or times, the format must be specified with the format key.
