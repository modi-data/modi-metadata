# The summary should contain a thorough description of the study design and execution.
# The description must be complete and self-contained, but can contain links
# to images and further information (but keep in mind that the description
# must make sense even if those links should stop working.)
# Multiline strings can be written by starting the value with a pipe symbol (|).

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata
# "Administrative metadata are collected for the effective operation and management of data
# storage and catalogues. This administrative information, covering various topics, is stored
# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."
administrative:

  # The version number of this dataset, used to keep track of different
  # versions if it is uploaded multiple times.
  # The version number can be numeric, date-based, or anything else, but
  # it must be easy to see which version is newer without further knowledge.
  version_number: 

  # The date this dataset was uploaded. Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  archiving_date: 

  # A unique identifier for this dataset. This will be used to identify this and
  # future updates in the metadata database, and must never be changed after the
  # dataset has been uploaded for the first time.
  unique_dataset_id: Example

  # Who has rights to use this dataset?
  rights: Example

  # Does the dataset have a specific license for usage?
  license: Example

  # Who can access the dataset?
  access: Example

  # Any constraints in usage of the dataset?
  constraints: Example

  # Can the dataset be used for free, or does usage incur any costs/billing for the user?
  billing: Example

  # When the data set will stop existing (for example due to privacy regulations).
  # Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  data_end_of_life: 2024-05-16

  # A more detailed description of the various processes of the data collection,
  # for example the methods/tools used to collect the data, filtering, post-processing,
  # storage file structure, etc.
  # This should include information about relevant conditions during the data collection
  # (for example weather, climate, time of day, etc).
  # Each key under "processes" can be custom made, and there can be as many as is
  # necessary. The proposed keys are just examples.
