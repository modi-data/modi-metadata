summary:
  why_was_it_collected: |
    Preparatory work prior to the first co-creation arena in UC Norway

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    A link to the survey was shared via email to project partners in UC Norway

  objectives: |
    First and foremost, to prepare the project partners for the topics to be discussed at the co-creation arena. E.g., their expectations to UC Norway and the co-creation arenas. The survey also included questions on CCAM in their organisation, problem drivers for CCAM and societal impacts of CCAM.

  research_questions: |
    What are your expectations to the Norwegian use case in the MODI project? What are your expectations to the cocreation arenas?

  experimental_plan: |
    The survey was first shared to all the project partners in UC Norway. After a while, we sent targeted emails to the project partners that had not answered the survey.

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata
# "Administrative metadata are collected for the effective operation and management of data
# storage and catalogues. This administrative information, covering various topics, is stored
# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."
administrative:
  # The version number of this dataset, used to keep track of different
  # versions if it is uploaded multiple times.
  # The version number can be numeric, date-based, or anything else, but
  # it must be easy to see which version is newer without further knowledge.
  version_number: 1

  # The date this dataset was uploaded. Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  archiving_date: 2025-01-20

  # A unique identifier for this dataset. This will be used to identify this and
  # future updates in the metadata database, and must never be changed after the
  # dataset has been uploaded for the first time.
  unique_dataset_id: modi_uc_no_cca_1_survey

  # Who has rights to use this dataset?
  rights: Open, see Access for contact info

  # Does the dataset have a specific license for usage?
  license: No - closed

  # Who can access the dataset?
  access: Everyone, contact andre.sande@sintef.no

  # Any constraints in usage of the dataset?
  constraints: N/A

  # Can the dataset be used for free, or does usage incur any costs/billing for the user?
  billing: The dataset can be used without cost as long as access and constraints are agreed upon.

  # When the data set will stop existing (for example due to privacy regulations).
  # Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  data_end_of_life: 2026-03-31

  # A more detailed description of the various processes of the data collection,
  # for example the methods/tools used to collect the data, filtering, post-processing,
  # storage file structure, etc.
  # This should include information about relevant conditions during the data collection
  # (for example weather, climate, time of day, etc).
  # Each key under "processes" can be custom made, and there can be as many as is
  # necessary. The proposed keys are just examples.
  processes:
    collection: |
      We used a survey tool called Netigate to develop the survey. Then, we generated a survey link that was shared to the project partners via email
    filtering: |
      This data set is the raw data
    aggregation: |
      This data set is the raw data, but aggregated data can be shared if neccessary

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."
structural:
  summary: |
    Microsoft Excel Workbook with 9 pages. The first is a title page, the second a minireport of the survey,
    and the rest of the pages ("Side 1" - "Side 7") contains the questions and answers of the survey.

  # File format. Please include attributes such as delimiter for CSV, decimal separator,
  # thousand separator (if any), and any other properties that is relevant for parsing the data.
  file_format: Microsoft Excel Workbook (.xlsx)

  # Please describe the storage structure of the data. If it consists of flat files, the folder
  # structure and file naming can be relevant. If it is a database, a description of the relevant
  # tables, indices, triggers and views is important.
  file_structure: |
    A single .xlsx file.

  # Which tools can be used to read the data. Especially important for non-standard formats.
  required_tools: Excel

  # If the files were made using a specific tool, the tool name and version may be relevant
  # for reading the data.
  tool_versions: N/A

  # Additional keys and values can be added here if this is a non-standard format that requires
  # a more detailed explanation.

# 5.3.1 Descriptive metadata
# "Descriptive metadata shall include detailed information needed to understand each part of a
# dataset. The purpose is to describe the dataset and build trust in it—by providing not only the
# characteristics of each measure or component, but also information about how the data were
# generated and collected."
descriptive:
  # The descriptions can vary by data type.
  # For each data field in your dataset, please fill out all relevant parameters from section
  # 5.3.1 of the DSF, and enter the attributes using the "Data description item" in lower-case
  # as the key. The following list lists the most relevant attributes from the tables, see
  # tables 3 to 9 in the DSF for full explanations.

  # - description
  # - data_precision
  # - unit
  # - sample_rate
  # - filter
  # - origin
  # - bias
  # - type
  # - definition
  # - range
  # - error_codes
  # - quality
  # - offset
  # - enumeration_specification
  # - availability
  # - srid (for coordinates)
  # - time_zone (for time stamps)
  # - time_format (for time stamps)

  # Please note the following additions to the DSF:
  # - When dealing with coordinates, the SRID must be specified with the srid key.
  # - When dealing with times, the time zone must be specified with the timezone key.
  # - When dealing with dates or times, the format must be specified with the format key.
