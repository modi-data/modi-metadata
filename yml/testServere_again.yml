# The summary should contain a thorough description of the study design and execution.
# The description must be complete and self-contained, but can contain links
# to images and further information (but keep in mind that the description
# must make sense even if those links should stop working.)
# Multiline strings can be written by starting the value with a pipe symbol (|).

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."
