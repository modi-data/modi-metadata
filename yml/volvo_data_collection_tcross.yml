# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."
structural:
  summary: |
    The dataset consists of 6 CSV files (tcross_1.csv through tcross_6.csv), each representing a separate T-crossing/intersection driving scenario.
    Each CSV file contains timestamped rows with the following data categories:
    - Position & Navigation: Unix timestamp, Longitude/Latitude coordinates (WGS84), Altitude, Heading

  # thousand separator (if any), and any other properties that is relevant for parsing the data.
  file_format: |
    .csv files with comma delimiter, period as decimal separator, no thousand separator

  # Please describe the storage structure of the data. If it consists of flat files, the folder
  # structure and file naming can be relevant. If it is a database, a description of the relevant
  # tables, indices, triggers and views is important.
  file_structure: |
    6 flat CSV files named tcross_1.csv through tcross_6.csv, each containing timestamped rows with 14 columns. 
    Data is recorded at high frequency with timestamps in microseconds since epoch. 
    Some fields may be empty for certain rows as sensors update at different rates.

  # Which tools can be used to read the data. Especially important for non-standard formats.
  required_tools: |
    Standard CSV readers (Excel, LibreOffice, pandas, etc.), text editors for viewing raw data

  # If the files were made using a specific tool, the tool name and version may be relevant
  # for reading the data.
