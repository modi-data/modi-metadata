    collection: |
      Volvo collected data for the MODI route between Oslo, Norway and Hamburg, Germany, on two different occasions (Oslo-Gothenborg in January 2025, Hamburg-Gothenborg in May 2025).
      The data collection was performed using a battery-electric Volvo truck equipped with various sensors and data logging equipment to capture relevant data for the MODI project.
      Video data was collected with a dashcam mounted in the front window.

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."
structural:
  summary: |
    Each CSV file contains timestamped rows with the following data categories:
    - Position & Navigation: Time (ISO 8601 UTC+1), Longitude/Latitude coordinates (WGS84), Altitude, Bearing
    - Vehicle Dynamics: Vehicle speed, weight, accelerator/brake pedal positions, steering wheel angle
    - Electric Vehicle Data: State of Charge (battery percentage), battery current and voltage
    - Lane & Road Detection: Lateral distances to left/right road lines, road edges, and outer road lines (vehicle coordinate system)
    - Object Detection (Objects 00-21): Detected objects with longitudinal/lateral distances, classification (car, truck, pedestrian, bicycle, etc.), and unique IDs

    Data is stored in a sparse manner with GNSS coordinates approximately every 250ms.
    All measurements use the vehicle coordinate system where +X is forward, +Y is left of the truck, and origin (0,0) is at the middle of the front bumper.

  # File format. Please include attributes such as delimiter for CSV, decimal separator,
  # thousand separator (if any), and any other properties that is relevant for parsing the data.
  file_format: |
    .csv files with comma delimiter, period as decimal separator, no thousand separator
    .mp4 files for video data

  # Please describe the storage structure of the data. If it consists of flat files, the folder
  # structure and file naming can be relevant. If it is a database, a description of the relevant
  # tables, indices, triggers and views is important.
  file_structure: |
    Flat files containing timestamped rows. CSV files store sparse data where not all columns have values at every timestamp.
    The datasets store data in a sparse matter, with GNSS coordinates approximately every 250ms.

  # Which tools can be used to read the data. Especially important for non-standard formats.
  required_tools: |
    CSV/text editor for tabular data, GIS tools for spatial data (.kml), video players for .mp4, network analysis tools for .pcap

  # If the files were made using a specific tool, the tool name and version may be relevant
  # for reading the data.
  tool_versions: N/A

  # Additional keys and values can be added here if this is a non-standard format that requires
  # a more detailed explanation.

# 5.3.1 Descriptive metadata
# "Descriptive metadata shall include detailed information needed to understand each part of a
# dataset. The purpose is to describe the dataset and build trust in it—by providing not only the
# characteristics of each measure or component, but also information about how the data were
# generated and collected."
descriptive:
  # The descriptions can vary by data type.
  # For each data field in your dataset, please fill out all relevant parameters from section
  # 5.3.1 of the DSF, and enter the attributes using the "Data description item" in lower-case
  # as the key. The following list lists the most relevant attributes from the tables, see
  # tables 3 to 9 in the DSF for full explanations.

  # - description
  # - data_precision
  # - unit
  # - sample_rate
  # - filter
  # - origin
  # - bias
  # - type
  # - definition
  # - range
  # - error_codes
  # - quality
  # - offset
  # - enumeration_specification
  # - availability
  # - srid (for coordinates)
  # - time_zone (for time stamps)
  # - time_format (for time stamps)

  # Please note the following additions to the DSF:
  # - When dealing with coordinates, the SRID must be specified with the srid key.
  # - When dealing with times, the time zone must be specified with the timezone key.
  # - When dealing with dates or times, the format must be specified with the format key.
