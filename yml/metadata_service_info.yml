summary:
  why_was_it_collected: |
    To test mobile network connectivity when crossing the border between Norway and Sweden.

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    Field test trial collecting several relevant parameters related to connectivity in 
    multiple runs across the border.

  objectives: |
    Learn how mobile network connectivity works when crossing borders.

  research_questions: |
    What is the expected delays and service behavior when crossing the border?

  experimental_plan: |
    Several trips with several smart phones each trip was travelled, resulting in 40 reg-
    istered trips across the Swedish-Norwegian border at Svinesund in both directions. Both
    high-end Samsung S21 smart phones with 5G connectivity and low-cost Motorola E6
    (without 5G) smart phones where used, with SIM cards from all three national operators
    in Norway (Telia, Ice and Telenor) used as well.

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata
# "Administrative metadata are collected for the effective operation and management of data

# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."

  processes:
    collection: |
      A test protocol was developed and implemented for Linux and Android to measure relevant 
      quality indicators. The test application sends specially crafted datagram messages to 
      a dedicated server on the internet to facilitate measurement of packet throughput rate 
      and packet loss independently in uplink and downlink directions. Round Trip Time (RTT) 
      was also calculated. On the Android application, parameters such as position, timestamp, 
      signal strength, operator, country code, technology (EDGE, WCDMA, LTE, LTE-CA, 5G-NSA etc.) 
      were measured about every second. Data packet size and rate are configurable independently 
      in uplink and downlink directions. In the tests, uplink packet size 200 with a rate of 2 Hz 
      and downlink packet size 800 bytes with a rate of 4 Hz were used. The analysis focuses on
      the downlink packet performance as seen from an application using off the shelf equip-
      ment.

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."

  summary: |
    Each trip was recorded as a separate CSV file. File with the corresponding id in 
    'modi_uc_no_border_crossing_network_packet_rate' was recorded on the same trip.

  # File format. Please include attributes such as delimiter for CSV, decimal separator,
  # thousand separator (if any), and any other properties that is relevant for parsing the data.
  file_format: csv with ';' as delimiter, ',' as decimal separator.

  # Please describe the storage structure of the data. If it consists of flat files, the folder
  # structure and file naming can be relevant. If it is a database, a description of the relevant
  # tables, indices, triggers and views is important.
  file_structure: |
    Flat files in a single folder, file names consists of [ID]_[date-time start of trip]-network-packet-rate.txt. 
    Headers are not included in the files, but the fields described below describes them in the correct order.
    The first 2 rows are metadata for the file and does not follow the same format as the rest.

  # Which tools can be used to read the data. Especially important for non-standard formats.
  required_tools: notepad, various CSV parsing libraries

  # If the files were made using a specific tool, the tool name and version may be relevant
  # for reading the data.
  tool_versions: N/A

  # Additional keys and values can be added here if this is a non-standard format that requires
  # a more detailed explanation.

# 5.3.1 Descriptive metadata
# "Descriptive metadata shall include detailed information needed to understand each part of a
# dataset. The purpose is to describe the dataset and build trust in itâ€”by providing not only the
# characteristics of each measure or component, but also information about how the data were
# generated and collected."
descriptive:
  # The descriptions can vary by data type.
  # For each data field in your dataset, please fill out all relevant parameters from section
  # 5.3.1 of the DSF, and enter the attributes using the "Data description item" in lower-case
  # as the key. The following list lists the most relevant attributes from the tables, see
  # tables 3 to 9 in the DSF for full explanations.

  # - description

  # - When dealing with coordinates, the SRID must be specified with the srid key.
  # - When dealing with times, the time zone must be specified with the timezone key.
  # - When dealing with dates or times, the format must be specified with the format key.
