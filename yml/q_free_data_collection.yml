summary:
  why_was_it_collected: |
    To investigate PDI and vehicles
    barriers for L4 driving the full
    stretch Rotterdam-Oslo.

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    Q-Free drove the entire MODI test route (with some minor detours) from Oslo to Rotterdam, then
    back from Rotterdam to Oslo. The Oslo – Rotterdam trip went from Oslo, through Gothenburg,
    Copenhagen, Hamburg and ended at Rotterdam, with an extra crossing of the border between
    Germany and the Netherlands. The trip to Rotterdam started on March 27th, 2024, and ended on
    March 30th, 2024.The return trip started in Rotterdam on April 4th 2024 and went through Bremen,
    Hamburg, then a detour to Flensburg, then Copenhagen and ended in Oslo on April 7th 2024.

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata

# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."
administrative:
  # The version number of this dataset, used to keep track of different

  # This should include information about relevant conditions during the data collection
  # (for example weather, climate, time of day, etc).
  # Each key under "processes" can be custom made, and there can be as many as is

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."
