    To test GNSS and mobile network connectivity in the MODI corridor between Malmö and Moss.

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    Field test trial collecting several relevant parameters related to GNSS and mobile network connectivity.

  objectives: |
    Test GNSS and mobile network connectivity in the MODI corridor between Malmö and Moss.

  research_questions: |
    How is the GNSS and mobile network connectivity in the MODI corridor between Malmö and Moss?

  experimental_plan: |
    Two Sierra XR80  4G/5G antennas and one Swift Duro GNSS receiver where mounted on a personal car, with two separate modems 
    connected to be able to measure both Telenor and Telia coverage throughout the route.

    Connectivity data was collected directly from the modems.GNSS data was recorded directly from the GNSS receiver. 
    The software used to collect the data was developed inhouse by Einride.

      Two Sierra XR80  4G/5G antennas and one Swift Duro GNSS receiver where mounted on a personal car, with two separate modems 
      connected to be able to measure both Telenor and Telia coverage throughout the route.

      Data was collected from three different sources. Connectivity data was measured with iPerf 3.18  and directly from the modems. 
      GNSS data was recorded directly from the GNSS receiver. The software used to collect the data was developed inhouse by Einride.
      Iperf was run in TCP mode and for the most part with unlimited bitrate, which means that the transfer speed is regulated entirely
      by TCP’s built-in congestion control and flow control mechanisms. The connection will try to utilize the maximum available 
      bandwidth by adjusting its congestion window based on network feedback (packet loss, delay, etc.).

      Each cellular modem has its own IMEI:
      - 351850975171524 (Telenor - Swedish SIM-card)
      - 351850975171268 (Telia - Swedish and Norwegian SIM-cards)

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."
structural:
  summary: |
    GNSS and cellular data in samples.json, and iPerf TCP data in iperf_tcp_intervals.json.
    There are also two files with start and end events for the iPerf TCP data, but these are not included in this metadata file.

  # File format. Please include attributes such as delimiter for CSV, decimal separator,
  # thousand separator (if any), and any other properties that is relevant for parsing the data.
  file_format: line delimited JSON (JSONL), with each line being a JSON object.

  # Please describe the storage structure of the data. If it consists of flat files, the folder
  # structure and file naming can be relevant. If it is a database, a description of the relevant
  # tables, indices, triggers and views is important.
  file_structure: |
    Flat files.

  # Which tools can be used to read the data. Especially important for non-standard formats.
  required_tools: notepad, various JSON parsing libraries

  # If the files were made using a specific tool, the tool name and version may be relevant

# 5.3.1 Descriptive metadata
# "Descriptive metadata shall include detailed information needed to understand each part of a
# dataset. The purpose is to describe the dataset and build trust in it—by providing not only the
# characteristics of each measure or component, but also information about how the data were
# generated and collected."
descriptive:
  # The descriptions can vary by data type.
  # For each data field in your dataset, please fill out all relevant parameters from section
  # 5.3.1 of the DSF, and enter the attributes using the "Data description item" in lower-case
  # as the key. The following list lists the most relevant attributes from the tables, see
  # tables 3 to 9 in the DSF for full explanations.

  # - description
  # - data_precision
  # - unit
  # - sample_rate
  # - filter
  # - origin
  # - bias

  # - quality
  # - offset
  # - enumeration_specification
  # - availability
  # - srid (for coordinates)
  # - time_zone (for time stamps)
  # - time_format (for time stamps)

  # Please note the following additions to the DSF:
  # - When dealing with coordinates, the SRID must be specified with the srid key.
  # - When dealing with times, the time zone must be specified with the timezone key.
  # - When dealing with dates or times, the format must be specified with the format key.
