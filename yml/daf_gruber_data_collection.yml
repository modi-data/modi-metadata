summary:
  why_was_it_collected: |
    To provide input to MODI deliverable D5.5: “Assessment of CCAM Implementation along the MODI Corridor”

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    DAF/Gruber drove most of the MODI test stretch from Rotterdam to Oslo and back, with some minor departures, especially in the Netherlands. 
    The drive was performed from June 6th to June 18th, 2024. During their drive, they collected various data from the vehicle, 
    the DAF systems in the vehicle, as well as an external dash camera: 
      - Lane detection data from the DAF video analysis system 
      - Sign detection data from the DAF video analysis system 
      - Camera feed from the video analysis system  
      - Various data from the CAN-bus 
      - A stand-alone Blackvue DR900x camera that captured the windshield view continuously

  objectives: |
    Sign and lane detection analysis from the MODI corridor.

  research_questions: |
    How is the GNSS and mobile network connectivity in the MODI corridor between Oslo and Rotterdam?

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata
# "Administrative metadata are collected for the effective operation and management of data
# storage and catalogues. This administrative information, covering various topics, is stored
# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."
administrative:
  # The version number of this dataset, used to keep track of different
  # versions if it is uploaded multiple times.
  # The version number can be numeric, date-based, or anything else, but
  # it must be easy to see which version is newer without further knowledge.
  version_number: 1

  # The date this dataset was uploaded. Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  archiving_date: 2025-08-13

  # A unique identifier for this dataset. This will be used to identify this and
  # future updates in the metadata database, and must never be changed after the
  # dataset has been uploaded for the first time.

  # Who has rights to use this dataset?
  rights: On request, see Access for contact info

  # Does the dataset have a specific license for usage?
  license: No

  # Who can access the dataset?
  access: On request, contact guus.arts@daftrucks.com

  # Any constraints in usage of the dataset?

  # Can the dataset be used for free, or does usage incur any costs/billing for the user?
  billing: The dataset can be used without cost as long as access and constraints are agreed upon.

  # When the data set will stop existing (for example due to privacy regulations).
  # Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

  # A more detailed description of the various processes of the data collection,
  # for example the methods/tools used to collect the data, filtering, post-processing,
  # storage file structure, etc.
  # This should include information about relevant conditions during the data collection
  # (for example weather, climate, time of day, etc).
  # Each key under "processes" can be custom made, and there can be as many as is
  # necessary. The proposed keys are just examples.

# 5.3.2 Structural metadata
# "Structural metadata are used to describe how the data are structured in relation to other
# data. Data are organized into a system (e.g., a database and/or file system), a structure or
# database schema and a data content format. The aim of structural metadata is to facilitate
# the initial phase of data re-use by providing the necessary documentation about how the data
# is organized. The description should include the file system, the file structure and how to
# interpret the contents of a data container. All components of the dataset need to be
# described."
