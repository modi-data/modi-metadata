summary:

  why_was_it_collected: |
    To test if geo-fence zones with varying pricing could change the driving pattern of a
    group of test persons.

  how_was_the_collection_executed: |
    Volunteers were recruited in the Trondheim area. Their vehicles got an OBU that
    recorded their GNSS position and speed every second, as well as displaying a map with
    the various geo-fence zones and their pricing.

  objectives: |
    Learn how road user charging together with geo-fencing was accepted by participants
    and investigate the readiness of the technology

  research_questions: |
    Would there be a change in behaviour as a result of the system? Is GNSS based road
    user charging practically possible for personal vehicles from an OBU perspective? 
    Is
    there acceptance for such a solution?

  experimental_plan: |
    The experiment was conducted for approximately two months, with different start ups
    and endings for all participants over a monthly period. In addition one pre-survey
    and one post-survey was conducted to capture acceptence data (not in this data set).
    The first two weeks, data was collected without showing the user any road charging or
    geo-fence information. These data were used as a baseline for driver behaviour.

  sample_selection_criteria: |
    Drivers license required, living in or near the Trondheim area, and volunteering for
    the experiment.

# 5.3.3 Administrative metadata
# "Administrative metadata are collected for the effective operation and management of data
# storage and catalogues. This administrative information, covering various topics, is stored
# along with the datasets. From a FOT data re-use perspective, the key role of administrative
# metadata is to cover access conditions, rights, ownership and constraints."
administrative:

  # The version number of this dataset, used to keep track of different
  # versions if it is uploaded multiple times.
  # The version number can be numeric, date-based, or anything else, but
  # it must be easy to see which version is newer without further knowledge.
  version_number: 1

  # The date this dataset was uploaded. Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  archiving_date: 2023-06-02

  # A unique identifier for this dataset. This will be used to identify this and
  # future updates in the metadata database, and must never be changed after the
  # dataset has been uploaded for the first time.
  unique_dataset_id: geoflow_raw_data

  # Who has rights to use this dataset?
  rights: Limited rights, see Access for contact info

  # Does the dataset have a specific license for usage?
  license: MIT

  # Who can access the dataset?
  access: limited, contact petter.arnesen@sintef.no

  # Any constraints in usage of the dataset?
  constraints: |
    Can not be presented anywhere in raw form, only after enough aggregation to anonymize
    each driver sufficiently.

  # Can the dataset be used for free, or does usage incur any costs/billing for the user?
  billing: |
    The dataset can be used without cost as long as access and constraints are agreed
    upon.

  # When the data set will stop existing (for example due to privacy regulations).
  # Must be in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

  # A more detailed description of the various processes of the data collection,
  # for example the methods/tools used to collect the data, filtering, post-processing,
  # storage file structure, etc.
  # This should include information about relevant conditions during the data collection
  # (for example weather, climate, time of day, etc).
  # Each key under "processes" can be custom made, and there can be as many as is
  # necessary. The proposed keys are just examples.
  processes:
    collection_preparation: |
      Volunteers were recruited through targeted social media ads and e-mails to relevant
      people or groups. Each volunteer got an OBU mounted in their vehicle.
    collection: |
      The OBUs mounted in the volunteer's vehicles collected data from the first day they
      were operational. For the first two weeks, the OBUs collected data silently, without
      giving the driver any information at all. These data are used as a baseline for
      driver behaviour.
      For the next 6 weeks, the OBUs HMI interface was active, and
      drivers were informed about road pricing zones and costs.
    anonymization: |
      All data are identified with the serial number of the OBU, and has no direct
      connection to the drivers. No further anonymization has been performed.
    processing: |
      Data was collected by the OBUs in each vehicle, and stored locally. Each time the
      unit was turned on, it would upload previously collected data.
    filtering: |
      This data set is the raw data, and has no filters.
    aggregation: |
      This data set is the raw data, and has no aggregations.
